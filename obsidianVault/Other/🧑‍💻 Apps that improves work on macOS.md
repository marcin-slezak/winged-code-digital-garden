Working on macOS is not so awesome out of the box as some people try to convince. Here is a list of the most critical (and free) applications that makes work on mac much more comfortable

## [Tiles](https://www.sempliva.com/tiles/) - Window manager

A large screen encourages to display of few applications at the same time but the arrangement of the windows by mouse is slow and annoying.
