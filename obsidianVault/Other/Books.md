### The one thing - Gary Keller with Jay Papasan

Reminded me that we are mortal, our willpower is limited and _maybe_ we should focus on stuff that matters.

### Blood, Sweat, and Pixels - Jason Schreier

I expected so much (over one million copies sold worldwide 🌍) and so huge disappointment 🤦‍. Really low meat to babble ratio and pseudoscience crap. Worst book i ever read 👹.

### The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind - Joseph Murphy

You will not find any technical details - for me it's just good set of bedtime 🛏 stories for people interested into software/game development crunches 🙈.
