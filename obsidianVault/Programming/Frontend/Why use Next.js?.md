Next.js give you a couple of things out of the box in comparison to create-react-app, for me the most important are:
- ***SSG (Static Site Generator) and SSR (Server Side Rendering)***: must-have if you are building public available landing pages üöÄ
- ***File system routing***: each file in the `pages` folder became a page so you do not have to play with react-router
- ***Image optimization ‚öñÔ∏è***
- ***TypeScript configuration***


There is also a huge community behind Next.js so it's easy to find a solution for a common problem.

p.s. I do not like Vercel hosting (the company that develops Next.js) - their admin panel UI is messy for me
