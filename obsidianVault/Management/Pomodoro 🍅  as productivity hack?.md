For me is just a tool ðŸ”§ - need to be used wisely. Pomodoro helps me to motivate myself when I have a bunch of boring tickets on the board but usually distract me easily when I'm in the middle of the mission where I do not need additional motivation ðŸš€

P.s. I do not use a physical timer what probably would be distracting for other people in the office. As a replacement I use a mobile application that is loved by my kids: [Mouse Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.litalico.mousetimer1).
